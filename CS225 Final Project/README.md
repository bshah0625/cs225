# Final Project
Data Set: OpenFlight<Br>
Traversal: BFS<br>
Link: https://youtu.be/PGZAowTDkAo<br>
Covered Algorithms: Dijkstra’s Algorithm<br>
Complex or Uncovered Option: Landmark Path (shortest path from a to b through c), Betweenness Centrality<br>
Overall written goal:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project is to identify the most frequently used paths and airports based on the data set obtained by OpenFlights to generate the shortest path between point A and point B. We will be using data structures such as graphs, dictionaries, and any other data structures that aids in reaching the goal of this project. In addition to implementing dikjstra’s, we also plan (very tentative) to implement the “Betweenness centrality” of each airport location to figure out how “important” the airport is in respect to all processed data points. <br>
	
## Steps to Run Program:
1. Open new terminal and ensure you are in the program folder <br>
2. Type "Make test" (without Quotations) into terminal and hit ENTER <br>
3. Type "./test" (without Quotations) into terminal and hit ENTER <br>
4. Wait until prompted to choose between the Normal Shortest Path (option 1) or Landmark Path (option 2) <br>
5. If you chose landmark path jump to Step 9. Else continue to step 6 for Normal Shortest Path<br>
6. Type in your Departure Airport Code (Ex. ORD, ATL, SEA) and press ENTER.<br>
7. Type in your Arrival Airport Code (Ex. LAX, DFW, JFK) and press ENTER.<br>
8. Wait for results to show and return to Step 4 <br>
9. Since you chose the Landmark Path option you will now have to enter your Starting, Middle, and Ending Airport Code <br>
10. Type in your Departure Airport Code (Ex. ORD, ATL, SEA) and press ENTER.<br>
11. Type in your Layover Airport Code (Ex. LAX, DFW, JFK) and press ENTER. This will be your layover airport code. <br>
12. Type in your Arrival Airport Code (Ex. SFO, PHX, MIA) and press ENTER.<br>
13. Wait for result to show and return to Step 4 <br>
